This directory contains the main script bm_segment and the scripts it calls.

bm_segment runs bone marrow segmentation for a set of defined patients.  This process ontains the following steps.
  Load PET and CT dicom data with dcm2mat.  The dcm2mat script was not developed by me, but by a previous student in our lab.
  Run whole bone segmentation with extract_bone_mask
  Locate PET and CT axial minima with find_axial_minima for intervertebral disk locations.
  Locate ends of the patient spine with find_spine_ends, and reject minima outside these bounds
  Segment each vertebra by eroding bone mask between adjacent minima
  Segment other bone marrow volumes by eroding the whole bone mask minus the vertebral marrow mask
  Produce the final bone marrow segmentation as the union of the vertebral and other marrow segmentations.
  
bm_plot produces summary plots for debugging or presenting results of segmentation process.  Requires bm_segment to be run beforehand.

  
Other helper functions are:
  ExtractNLargestBlobs - extract the largest connected components from a 2D binary image.  I did not write this script.
  ExtractNLargestBlobs3 - extract the largest connected components from a 3D binary image volume.  I modified ExtractNLargestBlobs to produce this script.
  SaveAnnotatedImg - allows for saving of overplotted matlab figures.  I did not write this script.
