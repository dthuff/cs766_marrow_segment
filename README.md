Code can be found in matlab/ - see matlab/README for running procedure

Proposal, midpoint report, and final report can be found in the repo wiki.  Copies of these documents, plus the final presentation slides, can be found in doc/

Result images are in images/

Due to data sharing restrictions, I cannot make available my raw input data. However, some publicly available PET/CT dicom data can be found on The Cancer Imaging Archive - for example: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Soft-tissue-Sarcoma
